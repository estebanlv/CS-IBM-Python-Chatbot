# CS-Project-V2

Things to do (practical):
- once the textanalyser is done, train the chatbot as much as possible
- start coding the sentenceanalyser for the chatbot (analyses the sentence from the user to extract key information) 
- create database for each topic and its useful links
- create algorithm that chooses what link to answer with to the user
- create the front face of the chatbot (the code that extract the message and sends it to the user via api)
