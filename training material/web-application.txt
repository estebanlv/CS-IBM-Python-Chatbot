Voice Agent with Watson enhances your call center operations by orchestrating Watson services and integrating them with the telephone network. Your voice agent can listen and respond to customers using natural language.

Connect Watson to the telephone
Connect Watson services to your telephone or call center network.
Train your voice agent
Train Watson to understand intents that a caller might have, respond to those intents, and reply to callers in a conversation. This training enables the Watson services to handle queries and answer questions from callers in real time.
Program your voice agent within Watson Assistant
By setting the action commands within your Watson Assistant dialog, you can do everything from changing barge-in behavior to hanging up the call during the conversation flow.
Customize with third-party APIs
Expand Voice Agent with Watson capabilities by incorporating a service orchestration engine (SOE) so that you can integrate third-party APIs. The SOE can listen for triggers from Watson to look up information in existing systems, either on-premises or in the cloud. You can also use the SOE to provide Watson with parameters that control what Watson tells a caller.

IBM® Voice Agent with Watson™ enables direct, automated voice interactions over the telephone between a cognitive voice agent and your customers. With Watson artificial intelligence at its backbone, your voice agent can communicate in a more conversational manner, and it can handle complex interactions that are difficult for traditional interactive voice response (IVR) systems.

Rumor Hound scrapes thousands of unstructured data sources in real-time, identifies rumors buried in the data, and provides a filtered list of rumored acquisition targets scored by recency and credibility

Analysts, portfolio managers and traders struggle to keep ahead of market moving merger and acquisition rumors because actionable m&a rumors can emanate from any one of countless digital data sources. Rumor Hound solves this problem by continuously scouring tens of thousands of public, digital data sources in real time to find actionable m&a rumors that haven't yet been priced into the stock. Rumor Hound understands what an actionable m&a rumor looks like in all its linguistic nuance. When Rumor Hound finds a rumor, the rumor is pushed to users via API, dashboard, customizable filters and notifications along with a score that measures the credibility of the source based on site demographics, social media influence, Alexa rankings, etc. Transcending the black box, Rumor Hound provides users with not just the credibility score but also the source URL where the rumor was found as well as the rumor snippet itself so that users can validate for themselves the action-ability of the rumor. We are observing that m&a rumors that emanate from low credibility sources that gain momentum and are picked up by higher credibility sources tend to move prices.

Through our Rumor Hound API, customers can access historical Rumor Hound data on hundreds of stocks. The Rumor Hound API covers m&a rumors for several thousand stocks. We continue to model Rumor Hound insights and as we identify predictive patterns, we will be happy to share reproducible research and data with API customers.

Topic Deltas listens to earnings calls in real-time, quantifying nuance and measuring sentiment deltas across calls and against market expectations. Tackles information overload in earnings calls by transforming messy data into quantifiable numbers

The primary value proposition of Accrete's Topic Deltas product is to improve the efficiency of investment processes by monitoring subtle shifts in topical sentiment across a vast number of earnings calls that would be physcially impossible for even an army of human analysts to achieve with any accuracy. Accrete's Topic Delta product ingests earnings transcripts and maps linguistic nuances to key topics, scores the sentiment of the language associated with these key topics and measures the delta between topics spoken about accross quarterly earnings calls. For example, if a public company executive mentioned in the previous quarterly earnings call that "Customer pipeline looks great" but in the current quarterly earnings call mentions that "Customer pipeline looks good", the subtle shift in language from very positive to moderately positive may not be accounted for in the actual reported numbers but could have material impact on the psychology influencing the company's stock price.

Through our Topic Deltas API, users can access 5 years of historical Topic Deltas on quarterly earnings call transcripts for each stock in the S&P 500. Additionally, via the API the user also gets access to upcoming topical sentiment scores, deltas and language snippets for easy self-validation for each stock in the S&P 500 within 8 hours post transcript release. Finally, as we continue to extract and model insights buried in the nuances of earnings call language, our preliminary research has been showing that significant shifts in aggregate topic deltas forecast >=25% price movements in the direction of the delta with ~71% accuracy, both in and out of sample. We believe that we are just scratching the surface with these cognitive insights and that there are many hidden features in the data that have yet to be discovered. API customers get access to our full historical data set, research results and methodology.

Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework optimized for extremely fast and large scale data processing, which you can access via the newly integrated notebook interface IBM Analytics for Apache Spark. You can connect to your existing data sources or take advantage of the on-demand big data optimization of Object Storage. Spark plans are based on the maximum number of executors available to process your analytic jobs. Executors exist only as long as they're needed for processing, so you're charged only for processing done.

Create Alexa Skills, Google Home Actions, Facebook Messenger Bots & Chatbots without Coding.

Conversation.one is a build-once-deploy-anywhere platform, where your app can be deployed as an Alexa skill, Google Home action, Facebook Messenger bot, or a chatbot on your website

In this example, you’ll build a basic “what happened today” conversational application that provides a dynamic and personalized response. A conversational app contains intents, entities, and responses that you want to deliver to your user. Intents are the mechanisms that pick up what your user is requesting (using entities) and that direct the app to respond accordingly.

For simple replies that don’t include information gathered outside of the conversation, you can define textual hard-coded responses. More advanced responses can be made using your own logic and integrations. In later sections, you’ll add responses gathered from an external API call. For now, let's cover the basics.
