IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service creates a cluster of compute hosts and deploys highly available containers. A Kubernetes cluster lets you securely manage the resources that you need to quickly deploy, update, and scale applications.
Features
Native Kubernetes Experience
Use the tools and APIs you already know for a single, consistent experience, even when working across different cloud infrastructures.
Leverage Watson
Easily integrate cognitive solutions with a variety of Watson APIs to extend the power of your applications.
Secure Clusters
IBM provides security features to protect your cluster infrastructure, isolate your compute resources, and ensure security compliance in your container deployments.
Self-healing Containers
Configure a custom Kubernetes cluster that auto-scales and recovers containers based on defined policies.
Logging and Monitoring
Use the built-in logging and metrics service to monitor the performance of both your clusters and containers.
Intelligent Scheduling
Kubernetes automatically deploys containers on compute hosts according to the available resources across the cluster.
IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service delivers powerful tools by combining Docker containers, the Kubernetes technology, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to automate the deployment, operation, scaling, and monitoring of containerized apps in a cluster of compute hosts.
Single-tenant Kubernetes clusters with compute, network, and storage infrastructure isolation	
Create your own customized infrastructure that meets the requirements of your organization.
Provision a dedicated and secured Kubernetes master, worker nodes, virtual networks, and storage by using the resources provided by IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer).
Fully managed Kubernetes master that is continuously monitored and updated by IBM to keep your cluster available.
Option to provision worker nodes as bare metal servers with Trusted Compute.
Store persistent data, share data between Kubernetes pods, and restore data when needed with the integrated and secure volume service.
Benefit from full support for all native Kubernetes APIs.
Multizone clusters to increase high availability	
Easily manage worker nodes of the same machine type (CPU, memory, virtual or physical) with worker pools.
Guard against zone failure by spreading nodes evenly across select multizones and using anti-affinity pod deployments for your apps.
Decrease your costs by using multizone clusters instead of duplicating the resources in a separate cluster.
Benefit from automatic load balancing across apps with the multizone load balancer (MZLB) that is set up automatically for you in each zone of the cluster.
Highly available masters	
Available in clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.10 or later.
Reduce cluster downtime such as during master updates with highly available masters that are provisioned automatically when you create a cluster.
Spread your masters across zones in a multizone cluster to protect your cluster from zonal failures.
Image security compliance with Vulnerability Advisor	
Set up your own repo in our secured Docker private image registry where images are stored and shared by all users in the organization.
Benefit from automatic scanning of images in your private IBM Cloud registry.
Review recommendations specific to the operating system used in the image to fix potential vulnerabilities.
Continuous monitoring of the cluster health	
Use the cluster dashboard to quickly see and manage the health of your cluster, worker nodes, and container deployments.
Find detailed consumption metrics by using IBM® Cloud Monitoring and quickly expand your cluster to meet work loads.
Review logging information by using IBM® Cloud Log Analysis to see detailed cluster activities.
Secure exposure of apps to the public	
Choose between a public IP address, an IBM provided route, or your own custom domain to access services in your cluster from the internet.
IBM Cloud service integration	
Add extra capabilities to your app through the integration of IBM Cloud services, such as Watson APIs, Blockchain, data services, or Internet of Things.
