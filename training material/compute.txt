The FortiGate Security Appliance on IBM Cloud service provides top-rated network and content security services. By combining an intuitive operating system and an applied threat intelligence platform, the service offers you exceptional workload security performance with better visibility and control. This all starts with the flagship firewall platform, FortiGate 300 series Security Appliance. IBM Cloud deploys a pair of dedicated single-tenant appliances that are connected upstream from your VMware servers. The appliances protect all the servers and virtual machines on the public VLAN of your instances.

The appliances are deployed in a highly available active-passive mode with synchronized configurations. IBM Cloud deploys the FortiGate 300 series Security Appliance within a Virtual Domain (VDOM) on the dedicated appliance, which gives you full access to that virtual domain without compromising the integrity of the appliance. You have virtually full access to advanced features and the ability to fine tune the appliance to a much higher degree than other products. The firewall blocks or shapes traffic before the traffic ever reaches your VMware servers. You can manage the FortiGate Security Appliance on IBM Cloud service by using the FortiOS Web Client or the Command Line Interface via SSH.
Fortinet on IBM Cloud provides top-rated network and content security services for your VMware environment. By combining an intuitive operating system and an applied threat intelligence platform, the solution offers you exceptional workload security performance with better visibility and control. This starts with the FortiGate Virtual Appliance. IBM Cloud deploys a pair of dedicated FortiGate virtual machines (VMs) and configures them on the management interface. Later, you can attach and configure other interfaces as needed. In addition, SNAT and firewall rules are created on the management NSX Edge along with static routes on the FortiGate VMs to allow outbound public internet access for license activation and for acquiring latest security policies and content.

FortiGate virtual appliances allow you to mitigate blind spots by implementing critical security controls within your virtual infrastructure. They also allow you to rapidly provision security infrastructure whenever and wherever it is needed. FortiGate virtual appliances have all the security and networking services common to traditional hardware-based FortiGate appliances. With the addition of virtual appliances from Fortinet on IBM Cloud, you can deploy a mix of hardware and virtual appliances, operating together and managed from a common centralized management platform.

Using the advanced FortiOS operating system, FortiGate appliances effectively neutralize a wide range of security threats facing your virtualized environment. Whether deployed at the edge as a front-line defense, or deep within the virtual infrastructure for inter-zone security, FortiGate appliances protect your infrastructure with some of the most effective security services available today by enabling the features you need: application control, web filtering, IPS, AV and malware to secure your workload.

The following licensing options are available for FortiGate virtual appliances:

Standard FW
Stateful Packet Inspection, VLAN Protection and Advanced Logging, Ingress/Egress Firewall Rules, SSL/IPSec VPN Termination and 24x7 support.

Standard FW + UTM
All Standard Firewall services PLUS Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) service (which includes: Antivirus, Botnet IP/Domain Service, Mobile Malware Security, FortiSandbox Cloud, Virus Outbreak Protection Service and Content Disarm & Reconstruct), as well as Web Filtering, IPS, Antispam, Application Control and FortiCare.

Security and compliance are the largest concerns of customers who are considering cloud infrastructure and thus the largest barrier to cloud adoption. To address this, IBM has partnered with Intel & HyTrust to create a "first to market" VMware solution that not only encrypts but also geo-fences data at the hardware level, providing users with a solid foundation to address their security and compliance concerns. Whether clients are looking to meet the upcoming GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) requirements, or just looking to reduce audit risk for PCI, HIPAA, and other common certifications, this solution is ideal.

IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization combines the power of IBM Cloud, Intel TXT (Intel Trusted Execution Technology), VMware, and HyTrust security software to give your business the benefits of cloud computing while maintaining the strongest levels of data protection, visibility, and auditing.

Intel TXT allows the reading and writing of platform signatures and other secrets (such as keys) into a discrete TPM chip. Intel TXT is built into Intel® Xeon® processors, and includes capabilities in the microprocessor, chipset, I/O subsystems, and other platform components. When coupled with VMware vCenter, HyTrust CloudControl (HTCC), and HyTrust DataControl (HTDC), Intel TXT helps verify whether hosts launch into a trusted state, identify the physical location of hosts, and helps these systems prevent an attack on the centralized infrastructure of a cloud. These capabilities reinforce confidentiality and integrity of data in the face of increasingly hostile environments.

IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization is deployed on the IBM Cloud infrastructure according to a VMware, HyTrust, IBM and Intel validated design reference architecture. IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization is initially deployed as a four-node cluster within the choice of client of available IBM Cloud Data Centers worldwide.

To implement this service, you must have an IBM Professional Services agreement to ensure best practice configuration parameters and optimal delivery time of your environment. Once the environment is built, it is handed to you for management.
Cloud security solutions help defend and protect the most important asset in the IT inventory  the hypervisor. For most organizations, their virtualization infrastructure is the crown jewel of the IT organization and the hypervisor the "one ring to rule them all". With that in mind, it is more important than ever to pay particular attention to cloud security solutions that help better harden the hypervisor, lock down access, and provide better visibility into and control over the environment.

With HyTrust CloudControl (HTCC) you get a variety of security and policy enhancements without impacting the GUI that your vSphere, NSX, and ESXi administrators already know and use.? HTCC is deployed as a transparent proxy, and it mediates the actions taken by hypervisor administrators using familiar interfaces. Approved actions are allowed, disapproved actions are blocked, and additional approval is enabled, with logging all along.

With IBM® Cloud Functions you can use you can use your favorite programming language to write lightweight code that executes app logic in a scalable way. You can run code on-demand with HTTP-based API requests from applications or automatically in response to IBM Cloud services and third-party events. The Function-as-a-Service (Faas) programming platform is based on the open source project Apache OpenWhisk.

Because Cloud Functions is serverless, you're not limited in the languages that you can use and you don't have to spend time explicitly provisioning backend infrastructure. You can focus on writing app logic instead of worrying about auto-scaling, high availability, updates, or maintenance. Out of the box, IBM provides the hardware, networking, software administration, load balancing, plugins, and so on. 
Despite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build by using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. Small and agile teams spend too much time with infrastructural and operational complexities such as fault-tolerance, load balancing, auto-scaling, and logging. These teams want a way to develop streamlined, value-added code with programming languages they already know, love, and that are best suited to solve particular problems.

The modular and inherently scalable nature of Cloud Functions makes it ideal for implementing granular pieces of logic in actions. Cloud Functions actions are independent of each other and can be implemented by using various different languages that are supported by Cloud Functions and access various backend systems. Each action can be independently deployed and managed, is scaled independently of other actions. Interconnectivity between actions is provided by Cloud Functions in the form of rules, sequences, and naming conventions. This type of environment bodes well for microservices based applications.

Another important argument in favor of Cloud Functions is the cost of a system in a disaster recovery configuration. Compare microservices with PaaS or CaaS vs. using Cloud Functions by assuming that you have 10 microservices, which use containers or CloudFoundry runtimes. This comparison equates to 10 continuously running and billable processes in a single availability zone, 20 when run across 2 AZs, and 40 when run across two regions with two zones each. To achieve the same goal with Cloud Functions, you can run them across as many AZs or regions as you like, without having to pay a penny of incremental costs.
