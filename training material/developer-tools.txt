Store captured events as long as you require, safe guarded on cloud class economical storage solutions. Query your collected event data via API or export your cloud activity data.
Simplify collection and improve your cloud security
Activity Tracker automatically captures your IBM Cloud events.
Use the IBM® Cloud Activity Tracker service to track how applications interact with the IBM® Cloud services. Use Activity Tracker to monitor for abnormal activity, and comply with regulatory audit requirements. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.

Activity Tracker offers high-level security governance for your IT resources in the cloud.
Activity Tracker provides a solution for administrators to capture, store, view, search, and monitor API activity in a single place.
Activity Tracker provides capabilities to download events that you can then use to generate an audit trail report. You might require these reports so that your organization complies with internal regulations and external industry and country regulations.
Compliance with internal policies and industry regulations is a key requirement in any organization's strategy, regardless of where applications run: on-premises, in a hybrid cloud, or in a public cloud. The Activity Tracker service provides the framework and functionality to monitor API calls and produce the evidence to comply with corporate policies and market industry-specific regulations.

When you work in a cloud environment, such as the IBM Cloud, you must plan the cloud strategy for auditing and monitoring workloads and data in accordance with your internal policies and with industry and country-based compliance requirements. You can use the information that is registered through the Activity Tracker service to identify security incidents, detect unauthorized access, and comply with regulatory and internal auditing requirements.

For example, you can use the Activity Tracker activity logs to identify the following information:

The users who made API calls to cloud services.
The source IP address from where the API calls were made.
The time-stamp when the API calls were made.
The status of the API call.

Use Alert Notification to get early notification of application or service issues before they affect your users. Spend more time innovating, confident you are not ignoring critical issues.
Never miss your critical alerts
Spend time innovating, you'll receive alerts when action is needed
Route alerts to the right people
Filter events to domain experts or support teams
Faster response times
Escalation policies can alert additional experts or management
On-call and on-duty scheduling
Route alerts to the on-call specialists based on their availability
Mobile app
The mobile app offers a subset of Alert Notification functions on iOS and Android devices
Use the Alert Notification service to create filter conditions for processing alerts, so that you receive only the alerts that you are interested in.

You can create notification policies that contain filter conditions that, when met, trigger notifications. Notification policies define which alerts you are interested in by filtering for the alerts that, for example, are of critical severity, and whether to send a notification. The recipients can be individual users or groups. If a recipient clicks a link that is in the notification email, the alert is acknowledged, which indicates to the other recipients that someone is working on that alert. Users can log in to Alert Notification and respond to the alert in the Alert Viewer. Notifications can be sent by email, SMS, voice, Slack, and push notifications.
You can refine the filters as much as you need and also specify frequencies of occurrence to match patterns in your IT environment. It is good practice to define your notification policies so that alerts do not trigger more than one notification. To achieve this, you can define multiple conditions in a filter. Use the Alert Viewer within Alert Notification to view alerts and take actions to resolve them.

Cloud Event Management can receive events from various monitoring sources, either on premise or in the cloud. Events indicate that something has happened on an application, service, or another monitored object.

Related events are correlated into an incident based on attribute values that match. This means that events such as alerts or notifications from monitoring tools are considered to be part of the same incident if they have the same information set in a specific attribute.

Events are deduplicated, meaning that if the same event occurs multiple times, not all are listed in the incident they are correlated into. Instead, the count for the same event is updated to show how many times it has occurred. By default, the event severity, summary, state, and type fields are updated on deduplication to always have the latest values.

You can use the Monitoring service in the IBM Cloud to automatically collect and measure key metrics from your environment and applications. No special instrumentation is required to collect metrics. For example, you can use information provided by performance metrics to monitor how a service is running in the cloud, detect resource bottlenecks, and keep an eye on the service level agreement (SLA). When you analyze performance data for a service, you can detect situations that can lead to a resource bottleneck and consequently affect your service SLA to your clients. By taking early action, you can prevent situations that can impact your business negatively.
